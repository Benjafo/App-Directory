                    I'm a full stack developer who believes the best solutions come from understanding both the technical requirements and the real-world problems you're trying to solve. While my core expertise is in React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker, I've worked across different stacks and can adapt to your technical requirements or preferences.

                    What I enjoy most about development is taking complex problems and building clean, practical solutions. Whether you're an individual with an idea or a business facing technical challenges, I focus on understanding your specific needs first, then implementing what actually works - not just what's technically interesting.

                    I handle both frontend and backend development, which means I can take your project from initial design through to a fully functional application without the need for multiple developers or handoffs. This makes communication simpler and keeps your project moving forward.
